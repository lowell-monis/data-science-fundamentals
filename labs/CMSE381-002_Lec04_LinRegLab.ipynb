    "For much of this course, I will follow the labs outlined in the textbook at the end of each section.  However, there are many portions of this book that rely on the `Boston` data set. Although this dataset has been a standard example for a long time, often used for teaching linear regression, it has some major issues with assumptions based around race and housing. An excellent in-depth description of issues in the data set can be found [in this medium post from a few years ago](https://medium.com/@docintangible/racist-data-destruction-113e3eff54a8). More recently, the data set has [marked as deprecated in scikit-learn 1.0](https://twitter.com/ogrisel/status/1442894248488046595), which essentially means that anyone loading it will encounter a warning, and is marked for removal in version 1.2.  For these reasons, we will not be using the dataset in this class. "
