# Data sets

The data sets in this directory are largely taken from the ISLR2 R package associated with the Introduction to Statistical Learning in R. A few of them have have been modified by the creators of the Data Science Fundamentals Course in Michigan State's Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. There are also "toy" data sets generated by faculty in the department. These data sets are attributed to the authors Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Balasubramanian Narasimhan, while the toy data are attributed to Prof. Elizabeth Munch. I own none of these data sets.
